        I was born and raised in New Delhi. Currently I reside in Melbourne,
        Australia. Prior to moving to Melbourne in 2023, I worked with various
        small and mid-size teams as a software engineer. I have worked at
        Openhouse, ReWorld Earth, Wetlands International, Virtetic, and more.

        I migrated to Melbourne to study a Masters of IT, and specialize in
        Artificial Intelligence. I completed a Bachelor of Science in Statistics
        from University of Delhi before this, sharpening my analytical and
        critical skills.

        When I&apos;m not working, you can usually find me reading up on variety
        of things (astrophysics, cricket, finance, ∞), going for hikes, or
        photographing natural landscapes.
